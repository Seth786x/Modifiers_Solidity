# Modifiers_Solidity
The contract uses a modifier to restrict access to the general public, ensuring that specific actions can only be performed by the admin. The modifier enforces that only the admin can call certain functions, such as setting new admin, which updates the admin address. This ensures secure access control within the contract.
