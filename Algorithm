Step 1 : Initialize Contract

       - When the contract is deployed, set the deployer's address as the admin.
         

Step 2 : Access Control Using Modifier

       - Define a modifier that checks if the caller is the admin.

       - If the caller is not the admin, revert the transaction with an error message.

       - Otherwise, allow the function to execute.

Step 3 : Admin-Only Function

       - Define a function to set a new admin address.

       - Apply the admin-only modifier to ensure only the admin can call this function.

       - Update the admin address with the new address provided.

Step 4 : Public Function to Get Admin Address

       - Define a function to return the current admin address.

       - This function can be called by anyone.
